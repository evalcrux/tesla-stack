Description of this Stack
--------------------

This project was born out of the need both a quickly deployable, reusable, and container-free techniques to get a full `Elastic Stack` up and running. There is tons to do, and I will keep tinkering to add things as I see fit. Things you see fit should be included to, so please fork, improve, submit PRs, raise Issues and Question. 

Inspired by work to pull in data from Tesla vehicles and utilize the stack for analysis, insight, and quickly building out new clusters and use cases. Some of the efforts here are clearly contrived, and should be considered cases for learning your way around the Elastic Stack and your data.
